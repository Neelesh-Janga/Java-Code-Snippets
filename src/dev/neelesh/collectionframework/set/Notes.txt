Set:
1. Insertion order is not maintained since it's not ordered collection unlike List.
2. Only one null value is allowed.
3. Doesn't contain duplicate values.
4. No indexation is possible because of unordered nature.
5. No new methods are provided in Set interface a part from Collection interface methods.

-----------------------------------------------

HashSet:
1. Data structure used internally is HashMap
2. Element is stored as Key and a dummy object is stored as value
3. It's not thread-safe. To make a Set thread-safe, use ConcurrentHashMap and call newKeySet() method and use it as a set.

-----------------------------------------------

LinkedHashSet:
1. Data structure used internally is LinkedHashMap
2. Maintains insertion order of the elements
3. It's not thread-safe. To make is thread-safe use Collections.synchronizedSet(linkedHashSet);

-----------------------------------------------

TreeSet:
1. Data structure used internally is TreeMap
2. Null value is not allowed.
3. Sorts the data based on natural ordering or comparator provided while instantiation.
